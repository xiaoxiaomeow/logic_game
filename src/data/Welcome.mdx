# Welcome to the Mathematical Logic Game!

In this game, we will be following <Star/> and her beloved familiar <Sapphire/> to **formally** prove mathematical theorems.

And this is the author. Generally, I will introduce the game rules and the interface, and <Star/> and <Sapphire/> will talk about the mathematical (mostly logical) insights on the current proof or topic. Technically you can skip all conversations between <Star/> and <Sapphire/>, or even my instructions throughout the game, but it is highly non-recommended: always look for important information provided in this column.

Now you can pick the first level and start your wonderful journey in the world of logic.
