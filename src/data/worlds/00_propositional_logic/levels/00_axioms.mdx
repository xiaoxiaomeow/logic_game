<Speak speaker="sapphire">
Hey <Star/>! Wanna play a game? I give you a collection of strings called **Axioms**, and you try to produce another string, following some specific rules. 
</Speak>

<Speak speaker="star">
Sounds like a games Axiomites might like playing. What are the rules? 
</Speak>

<Speak speaker="sapphire">
The first rule is really simple: 

- You can produce any string given as an axiom. 

As an example, I give you <FormulaLatex formula={meta.target}/> as an axiom. You try to produce the string <FormulaLatex formula={meta.target}/> from it. 
</Speak>

<Speak speaker="author">
To produce an axiom, navigate to the `Axioms` tab of your inventory, and click that axiom. A command will appear in the input bar, then simply press `Enter` or click `Excecute`. 
</Speak>

<ResumeUntil condition={proof => proof != null && proof.validate()} text="Complete the level to continue."/>

<Speak speaker="star">
Easy. 
</Speak>

<Speak speaker="sapphire">
Cool. We just showed that $\{p\to q\}\vdash p\to q$. 
</Speak>

<Speak speaker="star">
Uh ... okay, I guess $\vdash$ means that the subsequent string can be produced from the preceding ones? 
</Speak>

<Speak speaker="sapphire">
Exactly. Also, the $\vdash$ is read as **proves**. You can also say that the subsequent string can be **proved** from the preceding ones. 
</Speak>

<Speak speaker="star">
Oh. Did I just proved something? 
</Speak>

<Speak speaker="sapphire">
Probably not. Not something non-trivial. 
</Speak>
